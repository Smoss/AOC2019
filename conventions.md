The following are coding conventions
- use python
- use poetry for package management
- use python types through mypy
- add files for a given day `<x>` in the folder `src/day_<x>`
- solutions should be titled `day_<x>_part_<y>.py`
- read input from `day_<x>/data/input.txt` where `<x>` is the day number
- only update `pyproject.toml` with new libraries and packages
